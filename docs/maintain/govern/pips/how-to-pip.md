Polygon Improvement Proposals, or PIPs, are a way for the Polygon community to propose and
develop solutions to improve the Polygon protocols. PIPs are an important part of the Polygon
development process and provide a way for developers, researchers, and users to contribute to
the future of the Polygon network.

## Writing and Submitting a PIP

If you want to write and submit a PIP, there are several essential steps you
need to follow. Before you begin, ask yourself some questions that will help you
determine whether your idea is a PIP or a forum post:

- **Is it a PIP or an advertisement?**
- **Is your proposal unique?**
- **Why are you writing a PIP?**

Once you have a clear idea of your proposal, follow these steps to write and
submit your PIP:

1. Choose a topic
2. Research and gather information
3. Write the PIP
4. Gather feedback
5. Submit the PIP
6. Revise and finalize
7. Community review
8. Approval

### PIPs vs PRCs

While PIPs and PRCs serve as standards for proposing improvements and additions
to the Polygon protocols, there is a subtle difference in the scope of the proposals
they represent. PIPs can encompass proposals for broader improvements to the Polygon
protocols, such as changes to the protocol, upgrades to the blockchain, and new features.

PRCs, on the other hand, focus specifically on standardizing smart contracts on the
Polygon protocols, outlining proposed standards for smart contracts development and
deployment, such as token standards, and providing a common framework for developers
to build upon.

## Tips for Moving Your PIP Forward

To move your PIP forward, it's essential to write a well-researched and thoroughly
thought-out proposal. Use the Polygon community Forum to engage with the community,
reach out to relevant projects for feedback, and consider writing an article about
the relevance of your PIP. By engaging in discussions and seeking feedback, you'll
increase the chances of your PIP being accepted and contribute to the future development
of the Polygon network.
