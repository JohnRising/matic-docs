## Welcome to the Polygon Community Forum

At Polygon, we are committed to creating a decentralized, open-source, and
accessible-for-all web3 space, and this starts with an open community filled
with positivity, active engagement, open discussion of ideas, and mutual respect.

### Community Culture

The Polygon community Forum, and the wider community that uses the platform, are
dedicated to the development, betterment, and further decentralization of the Polygon
ecosystem. Our community culture is one of openness, inclusiveness, and positivity.

### Core Values

The rules and guidelines of the forum have been written to reflect the core values of
the Polygon ecosystem.

### Ecosystem First

We always prioritize the health of the ecosystem and community above particular interests.
Any intentional disruption or act that endangers the well-being of the Polygon community
will not be tolerated.

### Openness

The forum, by its nature, is open, accessible, and transparent. Feel free to share your
thoughts and ideas on anything and everything related to Polygon.

### Growth

We are here to build and advance Polygon's scaling solutions, but we are also here to build
ourselves and each other. Ultimately, if you find yourself wondering “should I post this?”,
ask yourself whether it aligns with the values presented above and the guidelines below.

### Guidelines

Much like the blockchain itself, the Polygon community does not discriminate against
participants based on their color, sexual orientation, gender, nationality, or background.
Therefore, we will not tolerate any derogatory comments whatsoever.

Let's work together to build a strong and inclusive community that promotes growth, innovation,
and the success of the Polygon ecosystem!
