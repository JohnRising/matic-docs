## What are PIPs?

Polygon Improvement Proposals (PIPs) describe standards for the Polygon ecosystem
and govern the process through which the Polygon community introduces, finds consensus
on, and implements changes to Polygon protocols. A PIP provides information to the
Polygon community about suggested changes to the Polygon protocols. PIPs are used by
authors to document proposed changes, understand community sentiment, incorporate
feedback, and provide technical specifications behind the suggested changes.

## The PIP process

The Polygon Improvement Proposal (PIP) process is a preliminary approach for
allowing the community to put forward protocol upgrades that aim at improving
Polygon PoS. This process is inspired by the PEP process, which has been used
in the development of frameworks for other open source projects, including
Ethereum and Bitcoin. As a guiding rule, it is recommended that all changes
originate from the Polygon community Forum and the PIP GitHub repository, in
the form of a proposal written in line with PIP-1. It is suggested to consult
with the Governance processes board regarding the implementation of different
types of PIPs as different classifications of PIPs have different implementation
flows.

### Who can propose a PIP?

Anyone can propose a PIP.

### Why submit a PIP?

- To introduce changes to the Polygon protocols.
- To offer new standards to the ecosystem.
- To encourage open and transparent discussion and decision-making about changes to the
  Polygon protocols, ensuring that any changes are well thought-out and aligned with the
  goals of the Polygon community.

### Where are the PIPs hosted?

The PIPs are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/maticnetwork/).

### What should I do before submitting a PIP?

Before submitting a PIP, look through the PIP list and the Polygon community Forum to see
if someone has had a similar idea. If so, join the discussion. If there is not a similar
proposal, submit the PIP yourself.

### What do I need to do if I want to write a PIP?

You can go to GitHub and use the suggested template to draft your PIP. After writing your
proposal, follow the steps described in PIP-1 and PIP-8.

### What does the PIP process look like?

Take a look at the [flowchart](https://github.com/maticnetwork/PIPs/blob/master/PIPs/PIP-1.md)
that explains how the PIP process works.

### What are the types of PIPs?

There are four types of PIPs that differ based on the changes the author wants to introduce:

- The **Core** category is for changes to the Heimdall and Bor protocols, which are the backbone
  of the Polygon network.
- The **Contracts** category is for changes to the Core contracts that are deployed on the
  Ethereum network.
- The **Interface** category is for improvements to the client API/RPC specifications and
  standards.
- The **Informational** category is for issues and ideas that the Polygon community can adopt.

### What is the difference between a PIP and a PRC and how to decide which one I am submitting?

PIP stands for Polygon Improvement Proposal, while PRC stands for Polygon Request for Comments.
PIPs are broader in scope and can encompass proposals for improvements to the Polygon protocols,
such as changes to the protocol, upgrades to the blockchain, and new features. PRCs, on the other
hand, are focused specifically on proposals for standardizing smart contract development on Polygon
protocols. PRCs outline proposed standards for smart contracts development and deployment, such as
token standards, and provide guidance on their implementation.
